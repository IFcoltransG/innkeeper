# It Is An Innkeeper
This is a melancholy, spooky, text-based interactive fiction game, created for the [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) in 48 hours. The jam theme "Roles Reversed" guided me to tell the story of a humble innkeeper in a world where heroes venture out on quests and die. This is the story that might be told of an NPC in an MMO, while the players prance about the countryside.

You can play the game for free online at the [Itch.io Page](https://ifcoltransg.itch.io/innkeeper).

## How it was made
It is written entirely in [Inkle's writing language Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) ([Ink source code here](https://github.com/inkle/ink)), then compiled using [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky)/[Ink.js](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) for the browser (with a couple of small adjustments to the resulting HTML). The autoplaying music is *Anamalie* by [Kevin MacLeod](https://incompetech.com) licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Dev logs on the Itch page detail my thought process.
